# Song Lyrics Translator and Theme Analyzer

This repository contains a React frontend Flask Backend project designed to take user input for a song and artist, retrieve its lyrics, translate them into Spanish, Italian, and French, and analyze the theme of the song. This project is built to facilitate language exploration and understanding of song themes.

## Features
